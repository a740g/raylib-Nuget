# raylib NuGet Package

This is the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/raylib/) for [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), a popular video game programming library by [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5). [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) is a simple and easy-to-use library designed to facilitate video game programming. It is highly inspired by the Borland BGI graphics library and the XNA framework. raylib is especially well-suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems, and educational purposes.

This package also includes [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp), a C++ wrapper library for raylib by [Rob Loach](https://github.com/RobLoach). This C++ header provides object-oriented wrappers around raylib's struct interfaces. While [raylib-cpp](https://robloach.github.io/raylib-cpp) is not required to use raylib in C++, the classes align the use of the raylib API more closely with C++'s language paradigms.

    <description>raylib is a popular video game programming library by Ramon Santamaria. raylib is a
      simple and easy-to-use library designed to facilitate video game programming. It is highly
      inspired by the Borland BGI graphics library and the XNA framework. raylib is especially
      well-suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems, and
      educational purposes. This package also includes raylib-cpp, a C++ wrapper library for raylib
      by Rob Loach. This C++ header provides object-oriented wrappers around raylib's struct
      interfaces. While raylib-cpp is not required to use raylib in C++, the classes align the use
      of the raylib API more closely with C++'s language paradigms.</description>
